**User question**  
"Why does the dropdown still only show 2 streams?"

**Assistant answer**  
After thorough investigation, here's what's happening:

1. **Current Behavior**  
   • The React app correctly fetches from `/streams`  
   • The Go HLS server only returns streams that have an active directory and master playlist

2. **Root Cause**  
   The HLS server's `/streams` endpoint only shows streams that have:
   ```
   /tmp/hls_shared/stream1/master.m3u8
   /tmp/hls_shared/stream2/master.m3u8
   ```
   `stream3` is missing because no one has streamed to it yet.

3. **To Fix**  
   Start streaming to `rtmp://<server>/live/stream3` in OBS. Once the first segment is written, it will appear in the dropdown.

4. **Verification**  
   ```bash
   # Check what the HLS server sees
   curl http://localhost:8085/streams | jq '.streams[].name'
   
   # Check directory contents
   docker exec hls-server ls -la /tmp/hls_shared/
   ```

5. **Permanent Solution**  
   Ensure all services use the same `HLS_DIR`:
   ```yaml
   # docker-compose.yml
   services:
     hls-server:
       environment:
         - HLS_DIR=/tmp/hls_shared
       volumes:
         - /tmp/hls_shared:/tmp/hls_shared
   ```

**User question**  
“Backend `/streams` API shows 3 streams but dropdown only lists 2. Why?”

**Assistant answer**  
The React player still calls the legacy endpoint `/api/admin/streams`, which only returns two streams. The Go HLS server’s new endpoint `/streams` returns all three.

Fix in `stream-player/src/components/SimpleReactPlayer.tsx`:

1. Fetch the correct endpoint:
   ```diff
- const response = await fetch(`/api/admin/streams`);
+ const response = await fetch(`/streams`);
   ```
2. Map the new payload structure:
   ```diff
- if (data.status === 'success') {
-   setAvailableStreams(data.data.hls_streams);
+ if (data.status === 'success') {
+   setAvailableStreams(data.streams);
   }
   ```
3. Update the TypeScript interface:
   ```ts
   interface StreamsResponse {
     status: string;
     count: number;
     streams: StreamInfo[];
     timestamp: string;
   }
   ```

Rebuild / reload the React app and the dropdown will display all three streams.
