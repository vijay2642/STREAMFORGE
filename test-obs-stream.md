# Testing OBS Streaming with StreamForge

## Current RTMP Capability Status

âœ… **YES! Our project CAN handle RTMP streams from OBS at `rtmp://localhost:1935/stream1`**

## What We've Implemented

### 1. **Proper RTMP Protocol Support**
- âœ… RTMP Handshake (C0/C1/C2 and S0/S1/S2)
- âœ… RTMP Chunk parsing
- âœ… Stream key extraction from RTMP connect commands
- âœ… Multiple concurrent streams support
- âœ… Viewer management per stream

### 2. **OBS Configuration Support**
Our server now properly handles:
- RTMP handshake that OBS sends
- Stream key extraction from OBS publish commands
- Multiple stream keys (stream1, stream2, etc.)
- Standard RTMP port 1935

## How to Test with OBS

### Step 1: Start the Stream Ingestion Service

```bash
cd services/stream-ingestion
./stream-ingestion
```

The service will:
- Start RTMP server on port 1935
- Start HTTP API on port 8080
- Listen for incoming RTMP connections

### Step 2: Configure OBS

1. **Open OBS Studio**
2. **Go to Settings â†’ Stream**
3. **Configure as follows:**
   - **Service**: Custom
   - **Server**: `rtmp://localhost:1935/live`
   - **Stream Key**: `stream1` (or any key you want)

### Step 3: Test the Connection

1. **Start streaming in OBS**
2. **Check server logs** - you should see:
   ```
   INFO: New RTMP connection from 127.0.0.1:xxxxx
   INFO: RTMP handshake completed successfully
   INFO: Extracted stream key: stream1
   INFO: Publisher started stream: stream1
   ```

3. **Check active streams via API**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/streams/active
   ```

## Architecture Benefits

### Multi-Stream Support
- Each stream (stream1, stream2, etc.) is handled independently
- Multiple OBS instances can stream simultaneously with different keys

### Real-time Monitoring
- HTTP API endpoints to monitor active streams
- Stream statistics (viewer count, bytes transferred, duration)
- Health check endpoints

### Scalable Design
- Each RTMP connection handled in separate goroutine
- Efficient memory management for stream data
- Support for multiple viewers per stream

## Next Steps for Production

While our current implementation handles OBS connections, for production use you'd want to add:

1. **Enhanced RTMP Features**:
   - Full AMF0/AMF3 parsing
   - Proper error handling and reconnection
   - Stream authentication and authorization

2. **Stream Processing**:
   - Real-time transcoding (H.264, different bitrates)
   - HLS/DASH segment generation
   - Stream recording and playback

3. **Monitoring & Analytics**:
   - Stream quality metrics
   - Viewer analytics
   - Performance monitoring

## Quick Test Command

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the service
cd services/stream-ingestion && ./stream-ingestion

# Terminal 2: Check if it's ready
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Terminal 3: Monitor active streams
watch -n 1 'curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/streams/active | jq'
```

**Result**: Your StreamForge project is now ready to receive RTMP streams from OBS! ðŸš€
